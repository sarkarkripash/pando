									</h2>

										<div class="accordion-body">
											<p>Your participation in the Affiliate Program is conditioned on your acceptance of these Terms of Service and all terms, conditions, and notices contained herein. Please read the Terms of Service carefully. If you do not want to agree to these Terms of Service, you must not participate in the Affiliate Program.</p>

											<div class="gap-20"></div>

											<h4>1. Eligibility for the Affiliate Program</h4>
											<p>To participate in the Affiliate Program, you must submit an application through PANDO MOTO’s Affiliate Signup, available at <a href="https://pandomoto.com/become-our-affiliate/">https://pandomoto.com/become-our-affiliate/</a>. PANDO MOTO reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to accept or reject any application for membership in the Affiliate Program for any reason. Affiliates must be at least 18 years old in order to participate in the Affiliate Program.</p>

											<div class="gap-20"></div>
											
											<h4>2. Referrals</h4>
											<p>You will receive a commission for Qualified Referrals to PANDO MOTO. The percentage of the commission may change at any time and without notice.</p>
											<p>“Qualified Referrals” mean customers referred by you to PANDO MOTO who: (1) click on your unique tracking link; (2) within ninety (30) days of clicking on your unique tracking link, successfully purchase.</p>
											<p>Affiliates who share the same personal/company details, including but not limited to, last name, email address, IP address, website details, or commission payment details, as their referred customer will be deemed to have made a “Self-Referral.” Referral commission and any earnings associated with this type of “Self-Referral” will not be paid. PANDO MOTO, in its sole discretion, will determine the classification of any referral as a “Self-Referral.”</p>

											<p>Referrals made to current PANDO MOTO customers will be considered “Current Customer Referrals” and referral commission and any earnings associated with Current Customer Referrals will begin accruing after the referral was made. You will not receive a referral commission for a Current Customer Referral for any payments the customer made to PANDO MOTO before the referral. PANDO MOTO, in its sole discretion, will determine the classification of any referral as a “Current Customer Referral.”</p>

											<div class="gap-20"></div>

											<h4>3. Commissions</h4>
											<p>Commissions earned on referrals become payable 30 days after the referred customer becomes a Qualified Referral. Your total commission amount must equal or exceed fifty Euros (EUR50) before receiving a payment from PANDO MOTO. If your total commissions for a given month are less than EUR50, payment will be held until the total commissions equal or exceed EUR50.</p>
											<p>If at any time a Qualified Referral files a credit card dispute, any earned Affiliate commission on the disputed charge shall become frozen in your account until the dispute is settled. You will not receive any interest on commissions that have been frozen. If the dispute is settled in PANDO MOTO’s favor, any associated earned Affiliate commission will become payable to you. If the dispute is settled in the Qualified Referral’s favor, any associated earned Affiliate commission shall not be paid to you. If commissions have already been paid out to you, the amount of earned commissions on the disputed charges shall be debited to your account.</p>
											<p>Commission payments will be paid in Euros and may be made via electronic payment (such as Paypal). You are responsible for paying all applicable fees associated with accepting payments, including but not limited to, currency conversion fees, transaction fees, withdrawal fees, deposit fees, etc.</p>
											<p>Commission payment will be made only after the proper invoice is issued.</p>
											<p>PANDO MOTO reserves the right to request documentation in order to approve your account. These requests may be made during the Affiliate Program application process or at any time while you have an active account in the Affiliate Program. If requests for documentation are not responded to in a timely manner, PANDO MOTO reserves the right to terminate, deactivate, or not approve your account.</p>

											<div class="gap-20"></div>

											<p>13. Affiliates shall not send any email in violation of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>

											<h4>5. Termination</h4>
											<p>PANDO MOTO may, in its sole discretion, terminate your participation in the Affiliate Program at any time, with or without cause, and without warning or notice. Without limiting the foregoing, PANDO MOTO reserves the right to terminate your account if it has been inactive for 12 consecutive months. PANDO MOTO reserves the right to terminate your participation in the Affiliate Program and not pay the accrued balance if you have been deemed to breach PANDO MOTO’s Terms of Use or these Terms of Service or engage in any conduct that PANDO MOTO deems to be illegal, improper, unfair, or otherwise adverse or detrimental to PANDO MOTO.</p>

											<div class="gap-20"></div>

											<p>In PANDO MOTO’s sole discretion, affiliate accounts generating a large number of fraudulent accounts or that are associated with any false or misleading advertising or suspected fraudulent activity will be deactivated.</p>
